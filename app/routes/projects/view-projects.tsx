The applications featured modules for solving complex numbers, differential equations, and electrical machine/apparatus problems, with step-by-step logic tracing and diagram generation to visualize processes. I also implemented PDF export functionality using templated outputs, enabling users to document solutions in a clear, formatted structure suitable for review or submission. These tools were widely used by hundreds of students in electrical engineering and information technology programs. In parallel, I worked as a tutor, teaching the underlying mathematical and scientific principles, and helping students understand both the theory and application of problem-solving methods through one-on-one and group sessions. This project exemplified my passion for combining software development with education, delivering practical solutions that significantly improved academic performance and comprehension.",

I designed and implemented reusable libraries in both C++ and Java to standardize calculations and streamline the development of new applications. These libraries enabled meâ€”and other studentsâ€”to quickly solve homework tasks by automating repetitive and complex mathematical processes. The solutions provided visual and numerical outputs to aid understanding. Although I occasionally used MATLAB, the majority of the work relied on custom applications built from scratch, at a time when tools like Wolfram Alpha were not widely available.
